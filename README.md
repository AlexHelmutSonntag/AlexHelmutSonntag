### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=page.id)
Glad to see you here! 

My name is Aly Elalwany and I'm a Computer Science student at ELTE. I'm from Egypt and currently studying in Budapest,Hungary.
I speak English and Arabic since I was born and I taught myself how to speak German from scratch amongst other skills as well.

I am currently taking on projects by University and looking forward to getting challenged on something that will expand my boundaries!
